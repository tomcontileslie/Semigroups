    Finitely presented semigroups and tietze transformations

  In this chapter we describe the functions implemented in &Semigroups; that
  extend the features available in &GAP; for dealing with finitely presented
  semigroups.

  <P/>
  
  Section
  <Ref Sect="Words and strings in finitely presented semigroups"

  (written by Maria Tsalakou and Murray Whyte) and Section
  <Ref Sect="Helper functions for creating semigroup and monoid presentations"
       Style="Number"/>
  (written by Luke Elliott)
  demonstrate a number of helper functions that allow the user to convert
  between different representations of words and relations.

  <P/>

  In the later sections, written and implemented by Ben Spiers and Tom
  Conti-Leslie, we describe how to change the relations of a finitely presented
  semigroup either manually or automatically using "Semigroup Tietze" ("Stz")
  transformations.

    This section contains various methods for dealing with words, which for
    these purposes are lists of positive integers.

    This section describes operations implemented in &Semigroups; that are
    designed to interact with standard &GAP; methods for creating finitely
    presented semigroups and monoids (see <Ref
    Chap="Finitely Presented Semigroups and Monoids"
    BookName="ref"/>).

      Creating semigroup presentations
    </Heading>
    It is possible to use &GAP; to create finitely presented semigroups without
    the &Semigroups; package, by creating a free semigroup, then
    quotienting by a list of relations. This is described in the reference
    manual
    (<Ref Chap="Finitely Presented Semigroups and Monoids" BookName="ref"/>).

    <P/>

    However, finitely presented semigroups do not allow for their relations to
    be simplified, so in the following sections, we describe how to create and
    modify the "Semigroup Tietze" object associated with an fp semigroup.
    This object can be automatically simplified, or the user can manually apply
    Tietze transformations to add or remove relations or generators in the
    presentation.

    <P/>

    This object is analogous to the "Tietze object" implemented for fp groups
    in the main &GAP; distribution
    (<Ref Chap="Presentations and Tietze Transformations" BookName="ref"/>),
    but its features are semigroup-specific. All of the functions used to
    create, view and manipulate Semigroup Tietze objects are prefixed with
    "Stz".
